THE THREE BEARS.</h1>


<p class="cap">THERE were once three bears, who lived in a wood,<br />
Their porridge was thick, and their chairs and beds good.<br />
The biggest bear, Bruin, was surly and rough;<br />
His wife, Mrs. Bruin, was called Mammy Muff.<br />
Their son, Tiny-cub, was like Dame Goose&#8217;s lad;<br />
He was not very good, nor yet very bad.<br />
Now Bruin, the biggest&#8212;the surly old bear&#8212;<br />
Had a great granite bowl, and a cast-iron chair.<br />
Mammy Muffs bowl and chair you would no doubt prefer&#8212;<br />
They were both made of brick-bats, but both suited her.<br />
Young Tiny-cub&#8217;s bowl, chair, and bed were the best,&#8212;<br />
This, big bears and baby bears freely confessed.<br />
Mr. B&#8212;&#8212;, with his wife and his son, went one day<br />
To take a short stroll, and a visit to pay.<br />
He left the door open, &#8220;For,&#8221; said he, &#8220;no doubt<br />
If our friend should call in, he will find us all out.&#8221;<br />
It was only two miles from dark Hazel-nut Wood,<br />
In which the great house of the three Bruins stood,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>That there lived a young miss, daring, funny, and fair,<br />
And from having bright curls, she was called Goldenhair.<br />
She had roamed through the wood to see what she could see,<br />
And she saw going walking the Bruins all three.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i-4.jpg" width="500" height="561" alt="THE BEAR, WITH HIS WIFE AND SON, TAKES A WALK." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE BEAR, WITH HIS WIFE AND SON, TAKES A WALK.</span>
</div>

<p>Said she to herself, &#8220;To rob bears is no sin;<br />
The three bears have gone out, so I think I&#8217;ll go in.&#8221;<br />
She entered their parlor, and she saw a great bowl,<br />
And in it a spoon like a hair-cutter&#8217;s pole.<br />
&#8220;That porridge,&#8221; said she &#8220;may stay long enough there,<br />
It tastes like the food of the surly old bear,&#8221;<br />
She tried Mammy Muff&#8217;s, and she said, &#8220;Mrs. B&#8212;&#8212;,<br />
I think your taste and my taste will never agree.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i-6.jpg" width="500" height="564" alt="GOLDENHAIR EATS UP TINY-CUB&#8217;S PORRIDGE." title="" />
<span class="caption">GOLDENHAIR EATS UP TINY-CUB&#8217;S PORRIDGE.</span>
</div>

<p>Then she tried Tiny-Cub&#8217;s bowl, and said, &#8220;This is nice;<br />
I will put in some salt, and of bread a thick slice.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i-9.jpg" width="500" height="559" alt="GOLDENHAIR BREAKS THE BOTTOM OUT OF TINY-CUB&#8217;S CHAIR." title="" />
<span class="caption">GOLDENHAIR BREAKS THE BOTTOM OUT OF TINY-CUB&#8217;S CHAIR.</span>
</div>

<p>The porridge she eat soon made her so great,<br />
The chair that she sat on broke down with her weight;<br />
The bottom fell out, and she cried in dismay,<br />
&#8220;This is Tiny-cub&#8217;s chair, and oh, what will he say?<br />
His papa is, I know, the most savage of bears,&#8212;<br />
His mamma is a fury; but for her who cares?<br />
I&#8217;m sure I do not; and then, as for her son,<br />
That young bear, Tiny-cub&#8212;from him shall I run?<br />
No, not I, indeed; but I will not sit here&#8212;<br />
I shall next break the floor through&#8212;that&#8217;s what I most fear;&#8221;<br />
So up-stairs she ran, and there three beds she found<br />
She looked under each one, and she looked all around;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>But no one she saw, so she got into bed&#8212;<br />
It was surly old Bruin&#8217;s, and well stuffed with lead.<br />
Mammy Muffs next she tried; it was stuffed with round stones,<br />
So she got into Tiny-cub&#8217;s and rested her bones.<br />
Goldenhair was asleep when the three bears came in.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption">THE BEARS COME HOME AND FIND THEIR PORRIDGE ALL GONE.</span>
</div>

<p>Said Big Bruin, &#8220;I&#8217;m hungry&#8212;to eat, let&#8217;s begin&#8212;<br />
<span class="smcap">Who has been to my porridge?</span>&#8221; he roared with such might;<br />
His voice was like wind down the chimney at night.<br />
"<span class="smcap">Who has been to my porridge?</span>&#8221; growled out Mrs. B&#8212;&#8212;;<br />
Her voice was like cats fighting up in a tree.<br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Who has been to my porridge and eaten it all?</span>&#8221;<br />
Young Tiny-cub said, in a voice very small,<br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Who has been sitting in my great arm chair?</span>&#8221;<br />
In voice like a thunder-storm, roared the big bear.<br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Who has been sitting in my good arm chair?</span>&#8221;<br />
Growled out Mammy Muff, like a sow in despair.<br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Who has sat in my nice chair, and broken it down?</span>&#8221;<br />
Young Tiny-cub said, and so fierce was his frown,<br />
That his mother with pride to his father said, &#8220;There!<br />
See our pet Tiny-cub can look just like a bear,&#8221;<br />
So roaring, and growling, and frowning, the bears,<br />
One after the other, came running up-stairs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption">THE BEARS FIND GOLDENHAIR ASLEEP IN TINY-CUB&#8217;S BED.</span>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Who has been upon my bed?</span>&#8221; old Bruin roared out,<br />
In a voice just like rain down a large water-spout.<br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Who has been upon my bed?</span>&#8221; growled out Mammy Muff,<br />
In a voice like her husband&#8217;s, but not quite so rough.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>"<span class="smcap">Who is lying on my bed?</span>&#8221; said young Tiny-Cub,<br />
In a voice like hot water poured into a tub.<br />
And Tiny-cub&#8217;s breath was so hot as he spoke,<br />
That Goldenhair dreamt of hot water, and woke.<br />
She opened her eyes, and she saw the three bears,<br />
And said, &#8220;Let me go, please, I&#8217;ll soon run down stairs.&#8221;<br />
But big Bruin was angry, and shouted out, &#8220;No!<br />
You had no right to come hither, and now you shan&#8217;t go.<br />
What we mean to do with you, ere long you shall find;<br />
You can lie there and cry till I make up my mind.&#8221;<br />
To Mammy and Tiny then did big Bruin roar,<br />
&#8220;Go and block up the chimney and nail up the door;<br />
This Goldenhair now has got into a scrape,<br />
And if I can help it, she shall not escape.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i-15.jpg" width="500" height="557" alt="GOLDENHAIR JUMPS OUT OF THE WINDOW." title="" />
<span class="caption">GOLDENHAIR JUMPS OUT OF THE WINDOW.</span>
</div>

<p>But Goldenhair saw that a window was there,<br />
(It was always kept open to let in fresh air),<br />
So she jumped out of bed&#8212;to the window she ran,<br />
Saying &#8220;Three bears, good-bye! Catch me now if you can!&#8221;<br />
To the window the bears ran as fast as they could,<br />
But Goldenhair flew like the wind through the wood.<br />
She said the bears&#8217; breath had filled her with steam,<br />
But when she grew older she said &#8217;twas a dream,<br />
And no doubt she was right to take such a view;<br />
Still, some part of the story is certainly true,<br />
For unto this day there is no one who dares,<br />
To say that there never existed <span class="smcap">THREE BEARS</span>.</p>

Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
